# Install Docker - 64-bit Debian Stretch Host

This repository is dedicated to the task of installing Docker on a 64-bit/i386 host OS that is based on Debian Stretch.  If you are using a 64-bit installation of Linux (or OS X or Windows), there is plenty of support for you elsewhere.

When you use the repository's installation script to install Docker, you can execute Docker commands WITHOUT prefacing them with "sudo".

## Prerequisites
You must have Git installed, and you must have Sudo privileges.

## Procedure
* Open a terminal window, and enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/jhsu802701/docker-64bit-debian-stretch-install.git
cd docker-64bit-debian-stretch-install
sh main.sh
```
* The screen output is saved in the log directory.
